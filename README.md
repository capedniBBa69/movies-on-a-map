This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app compiles displays a static listing of movie scenes and the addresses of where those scenes happened. So far the index only contains NYC movies. I'm hoping to add a map that pins the movies at their appropriate locations and other features for NYC before expanding locations.
