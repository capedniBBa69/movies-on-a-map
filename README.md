This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This website displays a static listing of movie scenes and the addresses of where those scenes happened. So far the index only contains NYC movies. I'm hoping to add a map that pins the movies at their appropriate locations and other features for NYC before expanding locations.

This project involved web scrapping the [on the set of new york website](http://onthesetofnewyork.com/home.html) using cherio.js, [cheerio documentation can be found here](https://cheerio.js.org/) and using nodejs and fs to clean up the data and write it up to a json file.

## Installation

Install NPM

Install local node_module packages.

```
$ npm install
```

### start

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Hot reload is setup, so the page will reload if you make edits.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

For a list of other create-react-app commands you can [check out their site for the available scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/) or check the package.json for the standard scripts.

## Things I plan to add

- Set up a server and serve the data using Express across each page
- Add individual pages for people to learn more about each movie
- Add sorting by popularity
