At the same time, she finds herself attracted to Frank, the divorced father of one of her students, as the two get to know each other via lengthy telephone conversations. For their first date he escorts her to a party at Bernice's apartment.\\nComplications arise when April discovers she is pregnant, the result of a quick and clumsy coupling with Ben on the kitchen floor just before he left her. April has longed to have a child all her life and is delighted with the news, but is confused and upset by Ben's sudden return, Frank's hasty departure, and Bernice's insistent attempts to create a bond btw them. Not helping the situation is the discovery Bernice voluntarily put her up for adoption a full year after her birth and not three days later at the urging of her parents, according to the scenario she initially presented. When April miscarries, her brother Freddy tries to counsel her, but ultimately she must rely on her deep-rooted faith to deal with the betrayals she has suffered not only at the hands of those she trusted but by the God she worships as well.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"http://onthesetofnewyork.com/locations/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundmeposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"East 78th Street\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    0,\n                    1\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"http://onthesetofnewyork.com/locations/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme08.jpg\",\n                \"http://onthesetofnewyork.com/locations/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme07.jpg\",\n                \"http://onthesetofnewyork.com/locations/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme06.jpg\",\n                \"http://onthesetofnewyork.com/locations/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme01.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"Manhattan\",\n            \"comment\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Anger Management\",\n            \"year\": \"2003\",\n            \"summary\": \"Mild-mannered timid businessman Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) who works for a pet clothing companyout of New York City.

So it's a good thing he planned ahead. Before he died, Gerry wrote Holly a series of letters that will guide her, not only through her grief, but in rediscovering herself. The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday in the form of a cake, and to her utter shock, a tape recording from Gerry, who proceeds to tell her to get out and \\\"celebrate herself\\\". In the weeks and months that follow, more letters from Gerry are delivered in surprising ways, each sending her on a new adventure and each signing off in the same way; P.S. I Love You. Holly's mother and best friends begin to worry that Gerry's letters are keeping Holly tied to the past, but in fact, each letter is pushing her further into a new future. With Gerry's words as her guide, Holly embarks on a journey of rediscovery in a story about marriage, friendship and how a love so strong can turn the finality of death into a new beginning for life.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"/psiloveyou/piiloveyouposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"Holly and Gerry's Apartment, 254 Broome Street and Orchard Street\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    0,\n                    1\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou08.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou07.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou09.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou10.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"Manhattan\",\n            \"comment\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Sharknado 2: The Second One\",\n            \"year\": \"22014\",\n            \"summary\": \"When Fin (Ian Ziering) & April (Tara Reid) are on their way to New York, a Category 7 Hurricane spawns Heavy rain, winds, storm surges, & deadly Sharknadoes.

To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus.
